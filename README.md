Getting Started
---------------

The easiest way to get started is to clone the repository:

```bash
# Get the latest snapshot
git clone https://github.com/ElishaKay/Social-Site-with-6-Authentications.git

# Change directory
cd myproject

# Install NPM dependencies
npm install

# Or, if you prefer to use `yarn` instead of `npm`
yarn install

# Then simply start your app
node app.js 

or:

nodemon app.js

```

**Note:** I highly recommend installing [Nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon).
It watches for any changes in your  node.js app and automatically restarts the
server. Once installed, instead of `node app.js` use `nodemon app.js`. It will
save you a lot of time in the long run, because you won't need to manually
restart the server each time you make a small change in code. To install, run
`sudo npm install -g nodemon`.


Obtaining API Keys
------------------

To use any of the included APIs or OAuth authentication methods, you will need
to obtain appropriate credentials: Client ID, Client Secret, API Key, or
Username & Password. You will need to go through each provider to generate new
credentials.

**Hackathon Starter 2.0 Update:** I have included dummy keys and passwords for
all API examples to get you up and running even faster. But don't forget to update
them with *your credentials* when you are ready to deploy an app.

 - **Authorized redirect URI**: http://localhost:3000/auth/google/callback
- Click on **Create Client ID** button
- Copy and paste *Client ID* and *Client secret* keys into `.env`

**Note:** When you ready to deploy to production don't forget to
add your new url to *Authorized Javascript origins* and *Authorized redirect URI*,
e.g. `http://my-awesome-app.herokuapp.com` and
`http://my-awesome-app.herokuapp.com/auth/google/callback` respectively.
The same goes for other providers.

| yarn.lock                          | Contains exact versions of NPM dependencies in package.json. |

**Note:** There is no preference how you name or structure your views.
You could place all your templates in a top-level `views` directory without
having a nested folder structure, if that makes things easier for you.
Just don't forget to update `extends ../layout`  and corresponding
`res.render()` paths in controllers.


Deployment
----------

Once you are ready to deploy your app, you will need to create an account with
a cloud platform to host it. These are not the only choices, but they are my top
picks. From my experience, **Heroku** is the easiest to get started with, it will
automatically restart your Node.js process when it crashes, zero-downtime
deployments and custom domain support on free accounts. Additionally, you can
create an account with **mLab** and then pick one of the *4* providers below.
Again, there are plenty of other choices and you are not limited to just the ones
listed below.

### 1-Step Deployment with Heroku

<img src="http://blog.exadel.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/heroku-Logo-1.jpg" width="200">
- Download and install [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/)
- In terminal, run `heroku login` and enter your Heroku credentials
- From *your app* directory run `heroku create`
- Run `heroku addons:create mongolab`.  This will set up the mLab add-on and configure the `MONGOLAB_URI` environment variable in your Heroku app for you.
- Lastly, do `git push heroku master`.  Done!

**Note:** To install Heroku add-ons your account must be verified.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/7KnCa5a.png" width="200">
- Open [mlab.com](https://mlab.com) website
- Click the yellow **Sign up** button
- Fill in your user information then hit **Create account**
- From the dashboard, click on **:zap:Create new** button
- Select **any** cloud provider (I usually go with AWS)
- Under *Plan* click on **Single-node (development)** tab and select **Sandbox** (it's free)
 - *Leave MongoDB version as is - `2.4.x`*
- Enter *Database name** for your web app
- Then click on **:zap:Create new MongoDB deployment** button
- Now, to access your database you need to create a DB user
- Click to the recently created database
- You should see the following message:
 - *A database user is required to connect to this database.* **Click here** *to create a new one.*
- Click the link and fill in **DB Username** and **DB Password** fields
- Finally, in `.env` instead of `mongodb://localhost:27017/test`, use the following URI with your credentials:
 - `db: 'mongodb://USERNAME:PASSWORD@ds027479.mongolab.com:27479/DATABASE_NAME'`

**Note:** As an alternative to mLab, there is also [Compose] but they charge after 30 days (https://www.compose.io/).
